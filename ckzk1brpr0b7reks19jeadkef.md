## What if?

Hi, I've been in hashnode since 2021 and I haven't created any script or blogs.
The same thing when I'm writing codes, I only do my projects on the local server and do not use git to track my progress.

But when the day I started to obsess with the green box on GitHub. That's the day when I actively created and pushed things in it. That little box is giving me dopamine that helped me to be consistent at my work.

> I'm just thinking that what if blogging sites have that dopamine box too?

The count is based on how long the blog is.

I just don't have any more to say other than this idea that comes up to my mind.

Thanks!
